## Crop Yield Prediction using ML 

## Project Overview
   This project uses PySpark to build a machine learning model for predicting crop yield based on historical 
 and environmental data. By leveraging distributed computing power, the model processes large datasets to 
 provide more accurate and efficient predictions.
