## Crop Yield Prediction using ML 

## Project Overview
   This project uses PySpark to build a machine learning model for predicting crop yield based on historical 
 and environmental data. The goal of the project is to build a predictive model that estimates crop yield based 
 on various input factors, such as weather conditions, soil quality, and historical crop data. This can help 
 farmers optimize crop planning, make informed decisions, and increase agricultural productivity.
 
 
 ##The files (.ipynb) can be viewed in Jupyter notebook to see file containt and training environment and all processed done on the data.
 
 	-just launch jupyter notebook if available through command line and then open the file from browser only.
 	or
 	-from the Visual Studio Code also we can access those files
